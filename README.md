# covid

Here is a little python script that downloads the covid19 data from **European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control**

[ECDPC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide)

It renames the file as: covid19_yyyymmdd.csv, where yyyymmdd is the current date.

If the file already exists it is replaced by the new one.
